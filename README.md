- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jacob1st
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computer science, programming and cyber security.
- All of my projects are random programs that I coded for fun. Some of them I wrote after learning about a topic that I wanted to test out, and figured it would be most fun if I turned into an actual miniture program. Feel free to use and improve any of the code. Thanks!

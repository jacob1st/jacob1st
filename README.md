ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Jacob Fuerst!
  
Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M  University. I love robotics, biomedical engineering, programming, and cyber security!
  
Outside of tech I enjoy playing chess and reading fantasy novels. *I have always wanted to learn to play the cello!*
  
Many of the projects I have here were just fun ways to help myself learn new programming topics, so feel free to use and improve any of the code. Thanks!!

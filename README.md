- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jacob1st
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming, computer science, mechanical engineering, robotics (especially prosthetics!), and cyber security.
- Every project I've worked on has been a program I wrote simply to enjoy programming. Many programs were created as an entertaining way to test out a new topic I learned of. Feel free to use and improve any of the code. Thanks!!
